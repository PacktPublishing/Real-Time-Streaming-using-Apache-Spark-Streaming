# Real Time Streaming using Apache Spark Streaming [Video]
This is the code repository for [Real Time Streaming using Apache Spark Streaming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/real-time-streaming-using-apache-spark-streaming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788391528), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Spark is the technology that allows us to perform big data processing in the MapReduce paradigm very rapidly, due to performing the processing in memory without the need for extensive I/O operations.

Recently, the streaming approach to processing events in near real time became more widely adopted and more necessary. In this course, you will learn how to handle big amount of unbounded infinite streams of data. You will analyze data and draw conclusions from it. Furthermore, we will look at common problems when processing event streams: sorting, watermarks, deduplication, and keeping state (for example, user sessions). You will also implement streaming processing using Spark Streaming and analyze traffic on a web page in real time.
